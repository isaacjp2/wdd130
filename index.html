                <p>Hello I from Ha√Øti, my name is Isaac Jean-Philippe, I am 22 years old. I developped my passion for computer since I had 8 years old, but
                    didn't had computer. When I had my first smartphone I watched a lot of videos about computer, during few years I developped some knowledge 
                    about it. Today I'm so Happy to have the opportunity to study in BYU-Pathway worldwide and BYU-Idaho online, for continu to developp my knowledge in computer.
