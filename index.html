                <p>Hello I from Ha√Øti, my name is Isaac Jean-Philippe, I am 22 years old. I developped my passion for computer since I had 8 years old, but
                    didn't had computer. When I had my first smartphone I watched a lot of videos about computer, during few years I developped some knowledge 
                    about it. Today I'm so Happy to have the opportunity to study in BYU-Pathway worldwide and BYU-Idaho online, for continu to developp my knowledge in computer. 
                </p>

                    flavorful cuisine, and colorful art. Despite facing challenges such as political instability and economic hardships, Haiti's resilient spirit shines
                    through in the warmth and hospitality of its people. With a rich history of revolution and independence, Haiti continues to captivate visitors with its
                    unique charm and allure.</p>
